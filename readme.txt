Allows publishers to easily customize the publication year of posts and pages.

== Description ==

Extending the literary, documentary, and archival potential of WordPress, this plugin allows publishers to easily customize the publication year of posts and pages.

== Installation ==

After installing and activating the plugin (http://codex.wordpress.org/Managing_Plugins), visit Settings > Advanced Dates. There, publishers can chose to either adjust dates site-wide or on a page-by-page and post-by-post basis. If a publisher choses the latter, s/he'll be able to selectively (de)activate the plugin, customize the annual differential, and (un)freeze dates on each page/post's editing screen.

Please note that the plugin will not take effect, even after activation, until a publisher chooses one of the two options in the Settings > Advanced Dates admin screen.

= Developer Notes =

S<span class="red">H</span> is very interested in the ways in which publishers use the Advanced Dates plugin. Please share ideas and usage notes in the comments section of the plugin URI: http://studiohyperset.com/wordpress-advanced-dates-plugin/4016

Also, the WordPress functions `get_the_time` and `the_time` work only on pages while `get_the_date` and `the_date` work only on posts. This is largely meaningless since developers can display the same date, time, and publication information using all four. Nevertheless, when developing a theme that builds on the Advanced Dates plugin, or trying to integrate the plugin into an existing theme, developers will want to keep these WordPress boundaries in mind.

Moreover, if a publisher or developer finds the plugin isn't working for a particular theme, it's likely the result of improper usage of one or more of the four date-oriented WordPress functions referenced above. For the Advanced Date plugin to work, developers need to use the `get_the_time` and `the_time` functions on pages and the `get_the_date` and `the_date` functions on posts.
